i have noticed that when we show the left side on the ReviewPage or old order basically
using the getParentRelationship, there can be cases where new comments get added to the 
comment thread and the left side of the page will become not updated. so left side should
be showing the saved left order and new comments that were added to the thread. the good
thing is that new comments added will always appear at the bottom of the thread so there
is unlikely going to be any confusion (if i am not missing anything).
